Superstore Sales Dashboard in Tableau

Developed an interactive sales dashboard for a Superstore dataset using Tableau to analyze business performance across various categories, sub-categories, and regions.

Focused on key metrics such as total sales, profit margins, and sales trends, segmented by categories and sub-categories of products.

Created visualizations including bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs to represent sales distribution, profit trends, and performance across different regions.

Used Tableauâ€™s filtering and drill-down capabilities to allow users to interact with the dashboard, providing deeper insights into specific regions, product categories, or time periods.

Enabled comparative analysis between product categories, sub-categories, and geographic regions to identify high-performing areas and opportunities for improvement.
